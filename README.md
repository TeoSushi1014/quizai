# QuizAI Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines strategies to improve website loading speed for the QuizAI application.

## Performance Optimizations Applied

1. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - Added Vite bundle visualization for easy monitoring
   - Implemented code splitting with manual chunking
   - Optimized third-party dependencies with proper tree shaking
   - Added Brotli and Gzip compression

2. **CSS Optimization**
   - Implemented critical CSS inline loading
   - Deferred loading of non-critical CSS
   - Added Tailwind CSS optimization (PurgeCSS, JIT mode)
   - Reduced CSS footprint with PostCSS optimization

3. **Resource Loading**
   - Added preconnect tags for external domains
   - Preloaded critical fonts
   - Deferred non-critical script loading
   - Optimized loading order to prioritize critical resources

4. **Caching Strategy**
   - Added proper cache headers
   - Implemented asset fingerprinting
   - Configured aggressive caching for static assets

## How to Build for Production

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the optimized production build
npm run build:production

# Preview the production build locally
npm run serve:prod
```

## Bundle Analysis

To analyze your bundle size and find optimization opportunities:

```bash
# Run the bundle analysis script
npm run optimize
```

This will generate a visual report at `dist/stats.html` showing the size of each bundle chunk and which modules take up the most space.

## Additional Optimization Tips

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF)
   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Consider using a CDN

2. **JavaScript Optimization**
   - Use dynamic imports for non-critical components
   - Avoid barrel files that break tree shaking
   - Lazy load third-party libraries

3. **Server Optimization**
   - Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for your hosting
   - Use a CDN for global distribution
   - Consider implementing a service worker for offline caching

## Performance Testing

To verify the optimizations are working:

1. Run a Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools
2. Use WebPageTest for detailed performance metrics
3. Monitor real user metrics with tools like Google Analytics or Sentry
